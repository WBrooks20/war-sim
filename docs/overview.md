## WarSim

### General overview

WarSim is an AI-powered war simulator leveraging GPT-4. WarSim takes place in two phases: the action phase and the battle phase. During the action phase, each faction takes a turn consisting of three actions. Possible actions are: Recruit to recruit new units and add them to the faction's unit reserve; start/join an attack campaign to start a new or join an existing attack campaign on a region; and start/bolster a defense campaign to start a defense campaign on an owned region or bolster an existing defense campaign with additional units. During the battle phase, each campaign undergoes a battle to determine who gets the region the campaign was started in. The battle simulates each faction's units attacking in turns. At the end of the battle, the faction with remaining units wins and becomes the owner of the region. If the campaign was an attack campaign, it is converted to a defense campaign containing the winning faction's remaining units in that campaign. After the battle phase, the sim switches the phase back to action, and each remaining faction takes a turn of 3 actions. If a faction has 0 remaining regions, the faction is dropped from the game. The goal is to be the only faction remaining.
